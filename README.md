- Responsive UI

## Technologies Used
- Flask
- Next.js
- Socket.IO
- SQLAlchemy
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- PostgreSQL

## Installation
### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set up PostgreSQL database and update `config.py`
6. Run database migrations: `flask db upgrade`
7. Start Flask server: `flask run`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Update API endpoint in `config.js`
4. Start Next.js development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage
1. Access the application in your browser
2. Register an account or log in
3. Explore chat rooms or create new ones
4. Send and receive real-time messages

## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/Flask server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/python/nextjs-flask/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:5328` port, which is where the Flask server is running.

In production, the Flask server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-title=Next.js%20Flask%20Starter&demo-description=Simple%20Next.js%20boilerplate%20that%20uses%20Flask%20as%20the%20API%20backend.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextjs-flask-starter.vercel.app%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F795TzKM3irWu6KBCUPpPz%2F44e0c6622097b1eea9b48f732bf75d08%2FCleanShot_2023-05-23_at_12.02.15.png&project-name=Next.js%20Flask%20Starter&repository-name=nextjs-flask-starter&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fexamples%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fpython%2Fnextjs-flask&from=vercel-examples-repo)

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-flask --example "https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/python/nextjs-flask"

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install

Then, run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

The Flask server will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5328 â€“ feel free to change the port in package.json (you'll also need to update it in next.config.js).
